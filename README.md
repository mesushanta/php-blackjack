# php-blackjack

A very basic simple PHP blackjack game using Object oriented PHP. This is the link to the exercise [BeCode](https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Lamarr-5.34/tree/main/2.The-Hill/php/4.oop-blackjackgame/code)

## What am I going to develop
This is the first exercise in Object Oriented Programming. There are prebuilt classes already provided with Cards, Deck and Suit. Thanks to the hard work already done for us. 
- Created Blackjack, Player and Dealer class
- Distributed two cards each to the player and Dealer
- Created the methods for the player to perform any actions in the game like, hit, surrender or Stand
- Displayed the result on the browser

## What I learned

- To create class
- To use the private and public variables and methods in the class
- Returning the private properties of the class using public methods
- To use class inside class as an parameter.
- The basic flow of how the OOP works.

## Rules Applied

- If player hit, he gets one more card and if the total is more than 21, he lose
- If player choose to stand, the Dealer get's new card until the total is not less than 15
- If player surrender, he lose. 
- At any point, if Player get 21, it's a clear win.
- If player stand, then the score is compared and the one who has more score, he wins otherwise it's a tie


## What's next

Implement more rules to make the game more professional. But I have very less understanding of this game so might do it later when I understand the more complex rules of the game.
